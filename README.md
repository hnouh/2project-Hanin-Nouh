### Application brief
Anime platform where studios can add-edit-delete their animes and their characters
So, the relation ship : one studio can have many animes

### Features
* Everybody can watch: all anime - series only - movie only
* Only studios can add- edit- delete their anime or character

### Most difficult part of the project
The design

### Would like to add next
* Another user devise for viewer so they can add their rate for specific anime and character
* More design
* Make type and category set by drop menu not as input text field so we can be sure that studios don't fall in wrong with spelling
* Add video for each anime
